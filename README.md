# My-First-Web-Scraper
This is my first web scraper built with iterations from sites https://realpython.com/python-web-scraping-practical-introduction/ and https://towardsdatascience.com/web-scraping-nba-stats-4b4f8c525994. The program makes an http request to ensure the site is valid, creates a dataframe from the table on the page and exports the dataframe to an csv file.
